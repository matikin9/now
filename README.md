This is what I'm up to right meow.  Inspired by [Liz](https://github.com/LearningNerd/now) & [nownownow.com](http://nownownow.com/).

## How's it going?

### Life in General

* __Work/Volunteering__: My role at work has been changing and the adjustment is a challenge.  I'm just a geek learning to navigate the world of the suits.  I'm helping run Hack For LA's weekly Civic Hack Nights.  We've got a few active project groups and I try to support them by bringing in knowledge experts and technical resources.  I went to GitHub's CodeConf, Big Data Day LA, an event on personal empowerment/branding, and the occasional MaptimeLA meetup.

* __Side Projects__: I updated my [personal website](http://ninakin.com) so that it actually has content.  For a long time I tried to do too much at once with it - learn project management techniques, learn new web platforms/technologies, create a perfectly branded portfolio and representation of myself, etc.  All that combined with regular bouts of self doubt, insecurity, and imposter syndrome means this was a big deal for me.  I haven't been working on any coding or crafting projects recently, but I'd like that to change.

* __Health__: I've gained a lot of weight since the beginning of the year.  I haven't been exercising and I haven't cooked at all.  I DID start riding Metro's bikeshare.  I've been unhappy about living in the suburbs - it's ~20 miles to DTLA and ~40 miles to Santa Monica.  This has made me uncharacteristically negative and I've been working to change that.

## Goals

  * Go to at least 1 MaptimeLA and 1 Learn To Code LA meetup event in August.
