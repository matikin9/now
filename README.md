This is what I'm up to right meow.  Inspired by [Liz](https://github.com/LearningNerd/now) & [nownownow.com](http://nownownow.com/).

## September 2016

### Life

* __Work/Volunteering__:
  *  I've realized that I like making connections and connecting people.  How can I turn that into a direction for my career?
  *  At Hack For LA we've got project groups... I love watching them grow!
  *  MaptimeLA is planning a camping/mapping trip to Catalina.  I'm trying to leverage my County contacts to find ways to make our trip useful.
  *  I held two crafting meetups!

* __Side Projects__: 
  * I started on a coding side project so that I could analyze my Metro Bikeshare trips.  It's on Github ([bikeshare-log](https://github.com/matikin9/bikeshare-log)).  I'm developing it in Cloud9 and I'm trying to limit the number of new things to learn.  So far it's just Python.
  * Growing out of this coding project I wanted to create a guide for myself (and others) to integrate Github, Cloud9, and Heroku and push a project to production.  This may be very useful for the HfLA groups too.
  * I continued knitting on my second Drachenfels shawl.  Maybe I'll finish by winter!
  * My cross stitch/embroidery is scattered throughout the house in various project bags.  I need to clean/organize the house to do anything.  :(

* __Health__: 
  * I've been riding Metro Bikeshare quite a bit.  With the bikeshare I can ride to a gym during lunch so I renewed my membership at LA Boulders.  It feels great to exercise regularly again, but it makes bike riding more tiring.
  * I tried out a productivity journal - the pages are available as a free PDF so you try it out for yourself before buying [SELF Journal](https://bestself.co/products/self-journal).  It was a little too much setup, but maybe I can hybridize it with the [Bullet Journal](http://bulletjournal.com/) system.  Yes, I'm obsessed with analog productivity tools and methods.
  * I got a haircut!


### Goals

* __Work/Volunteering__: 
  * Go to more meetups.
  * Keep to an every other week schedule for crafting meetups.

* __Side Projects__: 
  * Post a technical guide.
  * Write a narrative.

* __Health__: 
  * Go to the gym 3x/week.
  * Lose 5 lbs in September.


## August 2016

### Life in General

* __Work/Volunteering__: My role at work has been changing and the adjustment is a challenge.  I'm just a geek learning to navigate the world of the suits.  I'm helping run Hack For LA's weekly Civic Hack Nights.  We've got a few active project groups and I try to support them by bringing in knowledge experts and technical resources.  I went to GitHub's CodeConf, Big Data Day LA, an event on personal empowerment/branding, and the occasional MaptimeLA meetup.

* __Side Projects__: I updated my [personal website](http://ninakin.com) so that it actually has content.  For a long time I tried to do too much at once with it - learn project management techniques, learn new web platforms/technologies, create a perfectly branded portfolio and representation of myself, etc.  All that combined with regular bouts of self doubt, insecurity, and imposter syndrome means this was a big deal for me.  I haven't been working on any coding or crafting projects recently, but I'd like that to change.

* __Health__: I've gained a lot of weight since the beginning of the year.  I haven't been exercising and I haven't cooked at all.  I DID start riding Metro's bikeshare.  I've been unhappy about living in the suburbs - it's ~20 miles to DTLA and ~40 miles to Santa Monica.  This has made me uncharacteristically negative and I've been working to change that.

### Goals

* __Work/Volunteering__: 
  * Go to at least 1 MaptimeLA and 1 Learn To Code LA meetup event in August.
  * Comment on others' posts/grams/tweets at least once a week (to practice engagement).
  * Schedule a crafting meetup event in August.

* __Side Projects__: 
  * Start a web app project involving maps and databases, and have it on my website by the end of August.
  * Post a blog entry at least once a week.

* __Health__: 
  * Get a haircut.
  * Ride a bike for at least 1 hour a week.
  * Log what I'm eating every day.
